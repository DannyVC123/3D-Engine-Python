# Python 3D Engine
A 3D Engine created in Python with minimal use of built-in graphics libraries. All linear algebra operations were implemented manually.

# 3D Engine Progress
## 3D Projection
- Converts 3D objects onto a 2D screen
- Uses `pygame.draw.polygon` to color faces
- **Math:** [Weak Perspective Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Weak_perspective_projection)
- **Tutorial:** [I Made a 3D Renderer with just redstone! (mattbatwings)](https://youtu.be/hFRlnNci3Rs)

## 3D Rotation
- Rotates vertices by any angle *Î¸* around any unit vector **u** by clicking and dragging the 3D model
- **Math:** [3D rotation matrix from axis and angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#Rotation_matrix_from_axis_and_angle)
- **Tutorial:** [I Made a 3D Renderer with just redstone! (mattbatwings)](https://youtu.be/hFRlnNci3Rs), Wikipedia (see above)

## Backface Culling
- Does not render faces oriented away from the camera
- **Math:** [Surface Normal Dot Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-face_culling#Implementation)
- **Tutorial:** [3D Programming Fundamentals [Backface Culling] (ChiliTomatoNoodle)](https://youtu.be/h_Aqol0oTs4)

## Flat Shading
- Dynamic lighting for each face of the model
- **Math:** [Lambertian Reflectance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambertian_reflectance#Use_in_computer_graphics)
- **Tutorial:** [3D Programming Fundamentals [Flat Shading] (ChiliTomatoNoodle)](https://youtu.be/wOyavGx28uU)

## Triangle Rasterization
- Fills each triangle by calculating which pixels lie within the three edges using the [top-left rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation#Triangle_rasterization)
- Uses `pygame.PixelArray` instead of `pygame.draw.polygon`
- Doesn't look as clean as `pygame.draw.polygon` but is implemented without libraries and allows for features such as texture mapping
- **Math:** [Linear equations](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/line-equation-2points.html)
- **Tutorial:** [3D Programming Fundamentals [Triangle Rasterization] (ChiliTomatoNoodle)](https://youtu.be/9A5TVh6kPLA)

# .obj Files
## Read .obj files
- Render any 3D model of the .obj file format

## (Near-optimal) Bounding Sphere
- Calculates a near-optimal sphere that encloses all the vertices in a 3D model
- Used to translate the model to be centered at the origin
- Algorithm: [Ritter's bounding sphere](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242453691_An_Efficient_Bounding_Sphere)
